Format [`vfile`][vfile]s as **stringified** JSON.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-reporter-json
```

## Use

```js
var vfile = require('vfile')
var reporter = require('vfile-reporter-json')

var one = vfile({path: 'test/fixture/1.js'})
var two = vfile({path: 'test/fixture/2.js'})

one.message('Warning!', {line: 2, column: 4})

console.log(reporter([one, two]))
```

Yields:

```json
[{"path":"test/fixture/1.js","cwd":"/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-reporter-json","history":["test/fixture/1.js"],"messages":[{"reason":"Warning!","line":2,"column":4,"location":{"start":{"line":2,"column":4},"end":{"line":null,"column":null}},"ruleId":null,"source":null,"fatal":false,"stack":null}]},{"path":"test/fixture/2.js","cwd":"/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-reporter-json","history":["test/fixture/2.js"],"messages":[]}]
```

## API

### `reporter(files[, options])`

Generate **stringified** JSON for `files` ([`VFile`][vfile] or `Array.<VFile>`).

###### `options.quiet`

Do not output anything for a file which has no warnings or errors (`boolean`,
default: `false`).
The default behavior is to show a success message.

###### `options.silent`

Do not output messages without `fatal` set to true (`boolean`, default:
`false`).
Also sets `quiet` to `true`.

###### `options.pretty`

Given as `space` to [`JSON.stringify()`][json-stringify] (`boolean`, `number`,
or `string`, default: `0`).
When `true`, defaults to `2`.
