In CVAT you can use AWS-S3 and Azure Blob Container cloud storages to store image datasets for your tasks.
Initially you need to create a manifest file for your image dataset. Information on how to do that is available
on the [Simple command line to prepare dataset manifest file](/docs/manual/advanced/dataset_manifest) page.

After the manifest file has been created, you can upload it and your dataset to an AWS-S3 or
Azure Blob Container cloud storage.

After that you will be able to attach a cloud storage. To do this, press the `Attach new cloud storage`
button on the `Cloud storages` page and fill out the following form:
